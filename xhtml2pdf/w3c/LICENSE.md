## License notices for `xhtml2pdf.w3c`

The CSS parser functionality available in this submodule has originally been developed by TechGame Networks, LLC as part of their TG Framework module.
A copy of this code has been incorporated into xhtml2pdf to apply custom patches with the first commit in 2010, while adding a new original file `cssSpecial.py`.

The TG Framework changed its license from BSD-3-Clause to MIT according to the available Git history in March 2008.
As the corresponding file headers and the files inside the `w3c` directory have not been altered after 2007-04-04, the incorporated code can be used under both of these licenses.

Both BSD-3-Clause and MIT are rather permissive licenses and thus it should not pose a problem for xhtml2pdf.
All changes made to these files are subject to the general xhtml2pdf license, id est Apache-2.0 (see the `LICENSE.txt` file in the repository root for details).
